The core layer is where we place everything unrelated to our domain, such as utilities, technical implementations, or API.

For example:

the functions that connect to your database
the utilities that you use to authenticate users
the provider to send emails
the reusable UI components not related to any domain (ex. Dropdown, Button, TextInput)
and more.
